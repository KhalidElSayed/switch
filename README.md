Switch (Android)
================

Simple backwards implementation of the Android switch button.

Status
------

This a very early version of the library. Extensive testing hasn't been completed yet and there's a few items missing that should be available.

TODO
----

* Add support for a SwitchPreference
* Proper unit testing
* Proper support for themes and extending the styles
* Proper documentation
