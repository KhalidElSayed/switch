Switch (Android)
================

Simple backwards implementation of the Android switch button.

Include the following to use the library with Maven.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>co.novie</groupId>
    <artifactId>switch</artifactId>
    <version>0.3.0</version>
    <type>apklib</type>
</dependency>
```

The library is also available via direct download [here][2]

Status
------

This a very early version of the library. Extensive testing hasn't been completed yet and there's a few items missing that should be available.

TODO
----

* Proper unit testing
* Proper support for themes and extending the styles
* Proper documentation
